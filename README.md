# Maze-Creator-and-Solver
This project consists of a maze creator and solver. 
Maze creator is implemented by a Dsu data structure and giving weights to edges between each cell and merging cells with least edge weight and seeing its effect
dsu. As soon as starting and ending points are connected there is no need to join more edges.
Therefore each solvable matrix is produced with equal probability.
Then the maze is solved using Depth First Search(dfs) algorithm.
